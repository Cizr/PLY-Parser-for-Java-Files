# PLY-Parser-for-Java-Files


*PYTHON VERSION : Python 3.11.6*
This repository contains a subset that includes the following features:

**Integer and Boolean Variables**: You can create and manipulate integer and boolean variables to work with numeric and logical data.

**Arithmetic and Logical Operations**: Perform common arithmetic and logical operations on variables and values.

**Variable Assignments**: Assign values to variables, allowing you to store and update data.

**Conditional Statements**: Implement conditional tests using if statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.

**Simple Looping**: Create basic loops with for or while constructs, enabling repetitive execution of code.

This repository includes a PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) parser to read and process Java files. This parser can help you analyze and extract information from Java source code files, making it a valuable tool for understanding and working with Java code.
